# SYNOPSIS

    use Redmine::API;
    my $c = Redmine::API->new('auth_key' => 'MYREDMINE_REST_API_KEY', base_url => 'MYREDMINE_SERVER', trace => 1);

    #this command will POST to MYREDMINE_SERVER/time_entries.json
    #{time_entry => {issue_id => 3, activity_id => 9, hours => 1, comments => 'test'}} in JSON format
    $c->time_entries->time_entry->create(issue_id => 3, activity_id => 9, hours => 1, comments => 'test');
    

    #to get all time_entries
    $c->time_entries->list->all();
    #note that "list" is useless in that case, you can also use time_entry

    #to get one id
    $c->time_entries->time_entry->get(1);

    #to delete one entry
    $c->time_entries->time_entry->del(1);

    #to update one entry
    $c->time_entries->time_entry->update(1, hours => 2);

# OVERVIEW

Redmine::API is a module to communicate with Redmine thought the REST::Api.

It use [Net::HTTP::Spore](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::HTTP::Spore) and generate spec on the fly that matching your need.

Any result will be a spore object, with body and headers.

# NOTES

The Redmine API is not fully complete, and you should use the latest version to have access to the most features.

In the above example, I have access to the issues, so I can found the ID I want, but the activity\_id (which is mandatory) has not REST API route.
So you need to know it before sending something. You can also set it by default so the field become not mandatory.

# REST API

The complete doc of the REST API is here :

[http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Rest\_api](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Rest\_api)

If the API say : "GET /projects.xml" to get all project, you can do :

    $c->projects->list->all();

If the API say : "GET /projects/:id.:format", you can do :

    $c->projects->project->get(1);
